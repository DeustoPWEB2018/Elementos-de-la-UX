# Arquitectura de la información

## I.  Challenges of organizing information 
Organizing information is very important to inform people well. It’s like a library, it's very important to classify the books for people in order for them to find the information faster and easier. So, in this part, we will talk about the different classification’s challenges online.

### A.  Ambiguity
First, it’s important to say that the classification systems are built upon the foundation of language, meaning that words can have multiple meanings.  This ambiguity results in an unstable basis for our classification systems. If there are 15 definitions for a word, we run the risk that users lose our meaning. We need to be precise and agree with the labels and their definitions, but also with each document that we put on each category because the organization of words and sentences, considering their inherent ambiguity, presents a very real and substantial challenge.

### B.  Heterogeneity
Remember the definition of the heterogeneity, it refers to an object or collection of objects composed of unrelated or unlike parts. Websites are generally heterogeneous, in fact web sites often provide access to different documents and their different components. For example, links might lead to pages, sections of pages, or other web sites, and website provide access to documents in multiple formats like textual, video, audio, and interactive applications. The heterogeneous nature of web sites makes it difficult to impose any single structured organization system on the content, each format will have uniquely important characteristics. For example, we need to know certain things about images, such as file format (GIF, TIFF, etc.) and resolution (640 × 480, 1024 × 768, etc.).

### C.  Differences in perspectives
To design usable organization systems, we need to employ a mix of user research and analysis methods to gain real insight. Three important questions:  

-   How do users group the information? 
-   What types of labels do they use? 
-   How do they navigate?

This challenge is complicated because all users have different way of thinking. Maybe they will know our product, maybe not. For these reasons, it's necessary to think about the general understanding. The perspective is important by striving to understand the intended audiences through user research and testing.

### D.  Internals politics
In each company, or organization, there are politics, each entity wants to be influence because of this. So, the choice of organization and labeling systems can have a big impact on how users of the site perceive the company, its departments, and its products. We need to be careful in the choice of the information's organization. 

For example, on a company's website: Should we include a link to the library site on the main page of the corporate intranet? Should we call it The Library or Information Services or Knowledge Management? Should information resources provided by other departments be included in this area? If the library gets a link on the main page, why not corporate communications? What about daily news?
For these reasons, internal politics is very important and the information's organization impact on it. We need to be very prudent to prevent conflicts.

## II. Website organization 
The information’s organization is a major factor of success. For these reasons, these systems are composed of organization schemes and organization structures.

### A.  Organization schemes
An organization scheme defines the shared characteristics of content items and influences the logical grouping of those items. They are two types of organization schemes, exact and ambiguous. 

#### 1.  Exact schemes
Exact organization schemes are relatively easy to design and maintain because there is little intellectual work involved in assigning items to categories. They are also easy to use.

-   Alphabetic  al: An alphabetical organization scheme is the primary organization scheme for encyclopedias and dictionaries. We see information organized alphabetically by last name, by product or service, by department, and by format.
-   Chronological: Certain types of information lend themselves to chronological organization and the date of announcement provides important context for the release. For example, books, diaries, television guide etc.
-    Geographical: Place is often an important characteristic of information, political, social, and economic issues are frequently location-dependent.

But, users may also want to browse the releases by title, product, category, or geography, or to search by keyword. A complementary combination of organization schemes is often necessary.

#### 2.  Ambiguous schemes
Ambiguous or “subjective” organization schemes divide information into categories that defy exact definition. They can be difficult to use, with these ambiguous schemes, people don’t always know what we’re looking for.

-   Topic: Organizing informations by subject or topic is one of the most useful and challenging approaches. In fact, in designing a topical organization scheme, it is important to define the breadth of coverage. For example, some schemes such as those found in an encyclopedia, cover the entire breadth of human knowledge. In designing a topical organization scheme, we need to define the universe of content.
-   Task: Task-oriented schemes organize content and applications into a collection of processes, functions, or tasks. These schemes are appropriate when it’s possible to anticipate a limited number of high-priority tasks that users will want to perform. For example, word processing program with different tasks: modify, insert or Format. 
On the Web, task-oriented organization schemes are most common in the context of e-commerce web sites where customer interaction takes center stage. A website is rarely organized solely by task.
-   Audience: In cases where there are two or more clearly definable audiences for a web site, an audience-specific organization scheme may make sense. Audience-oriented schemes break a site into smaller, audience-specific mini-sites, thereby allowing for clutter-free pages that present only the options of interest to that audience.
-   Metaphor: Metaphors are commonly used to help users understand the new by relating it to the familiar. They can help users understand content and function intuitively. In addition, metaphors can generate new and exciting ideas about the design, organization, and function of the web site. To resume, metaphors can be useful while brainstorming, but it can insert incomprehension in our schemes.
-   Hybrids: It’s a mix of all the precedents ambiguous schemes. The very important thing is to preserve the integrity of each scheme.

### B.  Organization structure
An organization structure defines the types of relationships between content items and groups. They are two different approaches: Top-down & bottom-up.

#### 1.  Hierarchy: Top-down approach
It consists of deciding on the categories before of the content. They are two types of hierarchy:

-   Narrow & deep: To explain with an example, users started at Page A and need to do six clicks to reach the deepest content (Page B).
-   Broad & shallow: Users must choose from 10 categories to reach 10 content items. It’s the best option, better than the Narrow and deep. 

#### 2.  Database models: Bottom up approach 
The bottom-up approach it’s when we have the content and we decide after of the categories. It’s a dangerous approach. In this approach, we can use hypertext, but it’s rarely a good candidate for the primary organization. In fact, without context, users can quickly become overwhelmed and frustrated.
To conclude, it’s better to mix the both schemes.  

## III.    The social classification 
In this perspective, people can participate to the content, it’s fir example Twitter with the hashtags, the forum etc.
